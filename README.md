## Introduction
This repository contains the source code of the *Angular Final Project*.

## How do I run the project?
At first, you need to have installed on your machine the most recent version of Node.js. You can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/es/

You also need to have the latest version of Vue.js installed and its official CLI. You can download it by running the next command:
>npm **install** -g @angular/cli

### frontend:

Open the command line interface and get into frontend directorie. Then run the following command:
>npm **install**

If thereÂ´s an error, run the following command:
>npm **install** --legacy-peer-deps

Now you've got all required dependencies and modules. Don't remove the node_modules directory.

Finally, for runnning the server project, you might type in this command:
>npm **run** **serve** -o

And that's all. Go to your browser, search for *localhost:4242* and you should be redirected to the main page of the web.
